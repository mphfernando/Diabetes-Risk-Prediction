# Diabetes-Risk-Prediction
# Early-Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction Using R
This repository contains a data science and machine learning project aimed at predicting early-stage diabetes risk using various symptoms and demographic features. The project demonstrates the application of preprocessing, clustering, classification, and data visualization techniques to gain actionable insights into the dataset.

# Features

Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzes class and feature distributions to identify patterns.
Correlation Analysis: Identifies relationships between symptoms and diabetes risk through heatmaps and statistical measures.
Clustering: Implements k-means clustering with an optimal number of clusters determined using the elbow method.
Classification: Builds and evaluates a decision tree classifier, measuring performance through precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy.
Data Visualizations:
Correlation heatmap
Scatter plot (Age vs Gender)
Bar plots (Polyuria and Polydipsia vs Class)

# Technologies Used
Programming Language: R
Libraries: tidyverse, corrplot, ggplot2, rpart, caTools, cluster, rpart.plot
